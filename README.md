This ContactsManager is made using MVVM Architecture along
with DataBinding, LiveData and ItemLayout. Implemented a 
Model class named Contacts, ViewModel named MyViewModel for
handling the data between View and Repository. Used a DAO to 
access the ROOM DB from repository. ViewModel is used so that 
data stored doesn't be effected by change in screen orientation
and app crashes so that the data stored can be retrieved without 
any changes. The Video in the demonstartion shows that even if the 
app is cleared from the recent apps it still retains the data stored 
prior to it, and also implementation of itemLayout swipe right to delete 
feature.
